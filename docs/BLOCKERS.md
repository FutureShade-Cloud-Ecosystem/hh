# Blockers

Lane-by-lane record of anything that blocked or redirected work in this
repository. Newest at the bottom; never edit another lane's entry.

## HH-2.1 (skeleton)

- **No `fb` CLI exists yet.** The lane acceptance calls for `fb check` to exit
  0 on the empty skeleton, but `fb` is a platform deliverable that has not been
  built and there is no template repository to take it from. The lane provides
  `scripts/check-shape.sh` as the in-repo stand-in (it validates the App Shape
  layout, the manifest header, the `ci` job contract and the no-dashes house
  rule) and the `ci` job runs it. When the real `fb check` lands, replace the
  script call in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and delete this entry.
- **`hardscapeos_dibbits` carries no `CLAUDE.md` on `master` or `Demo`.** The
  lane brief says to read it at the repository root. The file exists only on
  the `fb/*` and `Feedback9_08_swarm` branch tips, byte-identical across all of
  them (blob `3d396ab1`), so the invariants were read from that blob. If a
  different revision was intended, diff `AGENTS.md` against it when it appears.
